# Dr. Jekyll vs Mr. Hyde an Analysis of Word Frequency
While watching Thor: Ragnorak I noticed that Hulk received a large portion 
of screen time compared to Dr Banner. That led me to thinking about the 
inspiration book Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of which the Hulk was partially 
based off of. Which led me to the question "Who was mentioned more in the book 
Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde" which I will attempt to in the Jupyter Notebook titled
Dr_Jekyll_vs_Mr_Hyde_Word_Frequency.ipynb.
